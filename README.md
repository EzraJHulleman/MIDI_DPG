# MIDI Drum Pattern Generator

This project aims to generate MIDI drum patterns using machine learning. The model is trained on a dataset of MIDI drum performances, with each performance tagged by genre, tempo (BPM), and other relevant musical metadata. The generated drum patterns are based on two user inputs: **genre** and **BPM**, allowing users to create rhythmically coherent drum loops tailored to their preferences.

## Features

- **User Inputs**: 
  - **BPM**: Specify the beats per minute (tempo) for the generated pattern.
  - **Genre**: Choose from a variety of musical genres such as funk, jazz, rock, and more.
  
- **Pattern Types**: The system generates either a "beat" or "fill" pattern, depending on the context.
  
- **Output**: The model generates MIDI drum patterns that can be used in music production software or for live performance.

The dataset includes various styles, time signatures, and beat types, allowing for a diverse range of drum patterns to be generated.
